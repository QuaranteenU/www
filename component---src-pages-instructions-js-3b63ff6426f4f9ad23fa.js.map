The campus includes a variety of houses, parkour courses, and more for you to enjoy! When you've had your fill, head to the center plaza to go up the stage.</li>\n      <li>From the plaza you'll see the entrance to the stage, you can either immediately ascend the stairs or take the paths to the sides to go to the front of the stage. The audience area also includes multiple levels in case you'd like a better view.</li>\n      <li>You'll notice that you can't walk onto the stage willy-nilly, this is done to prevent people from trolling and ruining a graduate's moment. Instead, when it's your turn you'll automatically be teleported onstage, where you'll have 30 seconds to do as you please. We highly recommend going to Professor Steve at the front and right-clicking him for your diploma! You're now <em>COMMENCED</em>!</li>\n      <li>After you'd had your 30 seconds of fame, feel free to stick around and support your fellow graduates, or just explore the campus! If you come back to the server after the event, you'll be able to play vanilla and Factions Minecraft too!</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <br />\n\n    <p>\n      We recommend you also{\" \"}\n      <OutboundLink href=\"https://twitch.tv/QuaranteenU\" target=\"_blank\">\n        open our Twitch stream\n      </OutboundLink>{\" \"}\n      so you can hear your name being called.
