The audience area also includes multiple levels\n        in case you'd like a better view.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        You'll notice that you can't walk onto the stage willy-nilly, this is\n        done to prevent people from trolling and ruining a graduate's moment.\n        Instead, when it's your turn you'll automatically be teleported onstage,\n        where you'll have 30 seconds to do as you please.
