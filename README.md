Built with Gatsby. Do `gatsby develop` to run with hot-reloading on localhost:8000.

Do `git worktree add -B gh-pages build origin/gh-pages` to connect the `/build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

Once this is set up, you can quickly do `gatsby build && cd build && git commit && git push` to do a release.
