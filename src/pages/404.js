      Unfortunately, we didn't have the budget to create the page you were
      looking for. However, I did find this button our developer left behind in
      the source code. Not too sure what it does...
    </p>
    <Button variant="danger" onClick={showBSOD}>
      DO NOT CLICK
    </Button>
  </Layout>
);

export default NotFoundPage;
